You can visualize the notebooks at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bnediction/profile_binr/tree/main/examples/

You can execute them using Docker in the current directory:
```
make run     # use run-isolated instead to avoid modifying the current files
```
and then go to https://127.0.0.1:8888.
